Activities through 12/13
========================

* **For class Monday, 12/5:**
    * Lecture will be a discussion of Final Project plans, Final Projects, and a review of REST APIs and getting data from the internet.
    * If you have been having difficulty with APIs, you should be here today! 
    * You are not required to read anything, but we strongly suggest you review :ref:`REST APIs<rest_apis_chap>`, :ref:`Using REST APIs<caching_responses>`.
    * You may also want to review :ref:`PS 8<problem_set_8>`, :ref:`PS 9<problem_set_9>` and :ref:`PS 10<problem_set_10>`.

* **For class Wednesday, 12/7:**
    * Read :ref:`APIs With OAuth <requests_oauthlib>` if you are interested in working with APIs like Twitter or Tumblr, which require more complicated authentication than Facebook.
    * We have posted code on Canvas (Files > Code Samples) called ``sample_twitter_code.py``. This contains code, commented with explanations, that you can use to access the Twitter API, and a demonstration of another way to use cached data. Read through it, install the ``requests_oauthlib`` library using **pip**, and try it out!
    * We will review how this code works in class (and you can use a lot of it to help you access Twitter for your project).
    
* **Section this week will be structured time to work on projects.** More info TBA.

.. note:: Schedule Your Project Work Time

    We also strongly suggest you spend time each day this week, even if it is just a few minutes, working on your project! Here's a suggested order of tasks:

        1.  Make sure you can grab data from both your sources and deal with it in Python.

        2. Write out English descriptions of everything you think you'll need to do for your project to get clear output. (You may change these along the way -- that's OK, it'll give you a good start.) Try writing some pieces of code, like your class definitions (like Problem #1 in PS10). And talk to staff about anything that was brought up in the feedback on your project plan!

        3. Write some unit tests that test for things you know you'll need your project to do: should the ``twitter_data`` variable you plan to use contain something that is a Python dictionary type? Write that unit test. Etc. 

        4. Check through the English plan you've written for yourself. e.g. perhaps it begins like, *"Get the last 100 posts from the University of Michigan Facebook page, and save it in a variable ``fb_umich_data``. Cache the data in a file."* And then, *"Define a class FacebookPost which should have the following instance variables and methods..."*, and so on. 

        5. Proceed through translating your English into code, one piece at a time, running your file every time you finish more code, to make sure it's working.

    The Facebook problem set (PS 10) is a good structure to base your project on!

* **Sunday, December 11 1 PM - 6 PM** is project work time at North Quad! Specifics TBA.

* **Before Sunday, December 11 at 11:59 PM:**
    * Complete :ref:`RR 13<reading_response_13>` on Canvas (linked below)
    * Complete your :ref:`final semester DYU<final_semester_dyu>` on Canvas (linked below)

* **Before Tuesday, December 13 at 11:59 PM (last day of classes):**
    * Submit your `Final Project <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/105657/assignments/131294>`_ on Canvas!

* **Your final exam for this course is December 16th, 1:30 - 3:30 PM.** 
    * Dates/times/locations of further review sessions and more exam info are upcoming. 
    * Just like for the midterms, you may bring one 8.5x11 double-sided sheet of notes with anything you like on it to the exam.
